# Instructions
Create a Restaurant class in a restaurants.py file with the following attributes:

.name of the type str
.type of the type str
.rating of the type float
.delivery of the type bool
Make these empty/default values for now.

Nothing should happen when you run the code, because we haven't used it yet. In the next exercise, we will start using this class!
