# Instructions
Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:

Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
Use each of these once in the program.

For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!

Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.
