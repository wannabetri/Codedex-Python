# Instructions
Suppose the holidays are around the corner, and the North Pole elves need your help to have thousands of LEGO toys packed and ready for shipping.

Create a inventory.py program with the following list:

lego_parts = [8980, 7323, 5343, 82700, 92232, 1203, 7319, 8903, 2328, 1279, 679, 589]

Each item in the list is the quantity of a colored part for a LEGO toy.

Can you figure out the following information using built-in list functions?

Which LEGO part are the elves running low on? Use min() to find out.
Is there a LEGO part that the elves are overstocking? Use max() to find out.
