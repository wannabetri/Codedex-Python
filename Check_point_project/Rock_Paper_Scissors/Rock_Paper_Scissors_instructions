# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic game that resonates with folks from around the world.

Create a rock_paper_scissors.py program where the user plays a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the computer.

The rules are as follows:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
First, create a player and a computer variable.

Prompt the player to select number between 1 and 3 with input() and store it in player:

1 is for “✊” (Rock).
2 is for “✋” (Paper).
3 is for “✌” (Scissors).
Then, use the random.randint() method to assign a number to the computer variable (1 to 3).

Lastly, use control flow to compare the user's choice and the computer's choice, determine the winner, and print out who won.

The output should look something like this:

===================
Rock Paper Scissors
===================
1) ✊
2) ✋
3) ✌️
Pick a number: 2

You chose: ✋
CPU chose: ✊
The player won!

Here's a note from the creator, Sam Kass:

“I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.”

Go back to your Rock Paper Scissors program and see if you can turn it into Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!

Use "🖖" for "Spock and "🦎" for "Lizard".

The output should look something like this:

================================
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
================================
1) ✊
2) ✋
3) ✌️
4) 🦎
5) 🖖
Pick a number: 3

You chose: ✌️
CPU chose: ✌️
It's a tie!
