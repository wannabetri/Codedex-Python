# Area Calculator

Create a calculator.py program that calculates the area of one of the following shapes:

Square
Rectangle
Triangle
Circle

The program should present a menu for the user to choose which shape to calculate, then ask them for the appropriate values (side, length, width, etc.).

Then, it should calculate the area and print it out.

Here are the area equations for each shape:

Shape	Equation
Square	area=side* side

Rectangle	area=length‚àówidth
Triangle	area=(height‚àóbase)/2
Circle	area=œÄ‚àó(radius*radius)

Note: For pi œÄ in the area of a circle, feel free to either use 3.14 or import the math module to use the math.pi variable.

The output should look something like this:
