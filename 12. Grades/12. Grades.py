''' Instructions
Holy moly, because the whole class's average was low on the test, the teacher just added in a curve for the test grades!

Create a grades.py program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.

Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value that's between 0 and 100.

Write a if/else statement for the following:

If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
Else, print "You failed."
After you run the code, change grade's value and run it again. Do this a few times to make sure it's working as intended.'''

# Write code below ğŸ’–

grade = 70

if grade >= 55:
  print("You passed.")
else:
  print("You failed.")
