Dice Roll
Suppose we have two dice. 🎲🎲

Create a game where one guesses the total value after rolling a pair of dice once.

Each die has the integer values 1 to 6. Since there's two dice, the range of possible values is between 2 and 12 (inclusive).

Use the random module to “roll” the dice.

Until the correct value is guessed, use a while loop to keep prompting the user for a number.

Use while loops along with methods from the random module to solve this challenge.

What is the total (2-12)? 10
What is the total (2-12)? 7
You got it!
