People say that every one year of a dog's life is roughly equivalent to seven years of a human's life.

Write a dog_years() function that has two parameters:

name (string)
age (integer)
It should calculate and return a string featuring the dog's name as well as its age in human years.

For example, if the dogs Landon, Red, and Cooper were 3, 6, and 2 years old respectively, the output would look like:

Landon is 21 years old in human years.
Red Bean is 42 years old in human years.
Cooper is 14 years old in human years.
