Why are there so many moon emojis? Each moon emoji represents a moon phase.

Create a moon_phase() function that takes in an phase parameter of the moon phase name given below and returns the correct moon emoji for it!

New Moon = ğŸŒ‘
Waxing Crescent = ğŸŒ’
First Quarter = ğŸŒ“
Waxing Gibbous = ğŸŒ”
Full Moon = ğŸŒ•
Waning Gibbous = ğŸŒ–
Last Quarter = ğŸŒ—
Waning Crescent = ğŸŒ˜
Call the moon_phase() and try it out:

answer = moon_phase("New Moon")
print(answer)      # Output: ğŸŒ‘
