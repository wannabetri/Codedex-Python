In some online multiplayer games, there's a KDA ratio to evaluate a player's in-game performance:

KDA=(k+a)/d

k is how many players you took down.
d is how many times you died.
a is how many assists you had.
Create a kda() function that takes in three parameters, k, d, a.

This function should calculate and return the KDA ratio that uses these paremeters.
