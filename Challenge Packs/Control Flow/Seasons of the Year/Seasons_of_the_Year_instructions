Ah, the four seasons in the year — winter, spring, summer, or fall; all you have to do is call.

Ask the user the month number using the input() function.

Check for the four seasons using an if/elif/else statement and logical operators:

month is 1, 2, 3, print "Winter ❄️"
month is 4, 5, 6, print "Spring 🌱"
month is 7, 8, 9, print "Summer 🌻"
month is 10, 11, 12, print "Autumn 🍂"
Everything else is "Invalid"
There are three logical operators: and, or, and not. Which one should you use?
