Create a weight conversion program that:

Asks the user what their Earth weight is.
Asks the user for a number that correlates with a planet.
Calculates the user's weight on the destination planet.
To calculate user's weight:

destination weight=Earth weight Ã— relative gravity
Number	Planet	Relative Gravity
1	Mercury	0.38
2	Venus	0.91
3	Mars	0.38
4	Jupiter	2.53
5	Saturn	1.07
6	Uranus	0.89
7	Neptune	1.14
