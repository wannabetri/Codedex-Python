# Instructions
Since 1996, the Pokémon video game franchise has delighted players around the world with collectible pocket monsters. A Pokédex is a device that tracks the information for Pokémon that are seen or caught.

Create a new file called pokedex.py.

Next, let's define a Pokemon class with the following attributes:

entry (integer)
name (string)
type (list of strings)
description (string)
is_caught (boolean)
Note: Make sure to use the __init__() method.

Next, create an instance method called speak() that returns a string of the sound a Pokémon makes.

Lastly, create three Pokemon class objects and use the speak() instance method for each one. For more information about any Pokémon you want to add, see the Pokédex!
