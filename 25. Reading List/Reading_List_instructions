# Instructions
Let's start a book club by making a list of tech startup books! ðŸ“š

Create a reading_list.py program that stores the following items in a books list:

'Zero to One'
'The Lean Startup'
'The Mom Test'
'Make It Stick'
'Life in Code'
Suppose we want to add one more book to the list: 'Zero to Sold'. Can you use a list method to do so?

Let's say we finished reading 'Zero to One' and 'The Lean Startup'. Can you use the .remove() method to remove one and the .pop() method to remove the other?

Print the updated list out to make sure everything's good to go!
