Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies.

Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders, it is designed to weed out 90% of job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively.

Want to give it a try?

Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100. Here's the catch:

For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
