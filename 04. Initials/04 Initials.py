''' Instructions
Create an initials.py program that displays your initials in block letters.

First, start your program with a comment that says a fun fact about yourself.

Then, create your block letters with your initials.

For example, if your name is Dua Lipa, your initials would be D and L, and your block letters would look like this:

DDDD   L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
DDDD   LLLLL'''

print('DDDD   L') #Dua Lipa show
print('D   D  L')
print('D   D  L')
print('D   D  L')
print('D   D  L')
