# Instructions
Fortune Cookie is a small cookie wafer with a piece of paper inside, called a “fortune”, which is usually a Chinese phrase with translation and a list of lucky numbers. They are served in restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. 🥠

Create a fortune_cookie.py program that gives the user random fortunes.

Define a function named fortune(). Inside the function, print out a random fortune from the list of options below:

Don't pursue happiness – create it.
All things are difficult before they are easy.
The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
Someone in your life needs a letter from you.
Don't just think. Act!
Your heart will skip a beat.
The fortune you search for is in another cookie.
Help! I'm being held prisoner in a Chinese bakery!
Make sure to use the random module's random.randint() and an if/elif/else.

Then, call the fortune() function three times and see what you get!

Bonus: If you're daring, rewrite the function without an if/elif/else.
