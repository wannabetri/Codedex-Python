# Instructions
Ever wonder how many people live in New York City? What about Tokyo? Or Delhi?

Create a new file called favorite_cities.py.

Let's make a City class that uses the __init__() method to define the following attributes:

name (string)
country (string)
population (integer rounded to the nearest thousand people)
landmarks (list of strings)
Next, create an object called nyc and assign the attributes mentioned above.

Lastly, make another object of the city or town that you live in!

Bonus: You can add more attributes if you wish, like any nicknames for your hometown!
