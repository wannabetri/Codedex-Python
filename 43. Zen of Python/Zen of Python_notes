# Congrats
Holy moly! You've reached the end of the final chapter of The Legend of Python! üßó

In this chapter, we learned about:

Using modules with the import keyword.
Some built-in modules from the Python standard library.
Importing specific tools from modules with the from and as keywords.
Packages and installing them with pip.
These last few exercises have really tested your Python programming abilities. You made it through them all and you should be super proud of yourself! üôå

We have one final gift for you.

# Instructions
Remember when you wrote a letter to yourself called letter.py in the very first chapter? We are giving it back to you!

Please feel free to revisit your letter.py and reflect on what you wrote to yourself all those chapters ago!

Now go back to part 3, "What you are going to accomplish in this course." Instead of saying "In this course, I want to...", say "In this course, I have...", because you worked hard to get to this point!

Here's one last parting gift.

Open your terminal and type python to prompt it for Python code.

Note: If this doesn't work, try running python3 instead.

Then, run the following code for some eternal words of wisdom (or run it on our side editor üëâ):

import this

This is a poem written by Tim Peter, a long-time Pythonista who wrote down Python's design style guide using 20 aphorisms. Only 19 are written down. 40+ programs later, you might be able to decipher what Tim's trying to say.

Write this down in your notes. Make sure to keep it on you for the rest of the journey.

The end is just the beginning. We look forward to seeing what you build.

Are you ready to take on the final project?! Feel free to select the "Project" button below if you are.

Go forth and make us proud! (‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•)
