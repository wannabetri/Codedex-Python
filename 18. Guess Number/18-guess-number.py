'''# Instructions
Let's continue on from the code above.

Create a guess.py program and type in the following:

guess = 0

while guess != 6:
  guess = int(input("Guess the number:  "))

print("You got it!")

Run the code a few times so that you understand what it does.

Let's make it so that it's the same guessing game, but there is a new limit to the number of tries (it was infinite before).

First, introduce a variable called tries at the top and give it a value of 0.

Then, add the tries variable to the while loop using a relational operator (like you did with guess).'''

# Write code below ðŸ’–

guess = 0
tries = 0

while guess != 6 and tries < 5:
  tries = tries + 1
  guess = int(input("Guess the number:  "))

if guess != 6:
  print('You ran out of tries.')
else:
  print("You got it!")
