# Instructions
A bucket list is a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime.

Create a bucket_list.py program with your own unique bucket list.

First, create a things_to_do list, and add things you want to do in your lifetime.

For example:

things_to_do = [
  '🚀 Create the coolest learn to code platform ever.',
  '⛰️ Hike the Pacific Crest Trail.',
  '🏡 Build an A-frame house and raise some goats.',
  '🌏 Live somewhere in Asia for a year.',
  '🎸 Release an album.',
  '📝 Write a book.',
  '🏆 Reach 100k subscribers on YouTube.',
  '🚐 Road trip with the fam.',
  '🍳 Open a cozy diner upstate.',
  '👴🏻 Grow old with no regrets.'
]

Now, iterate over the list and print everything out.

Lastly, to keep yourself accountable, take a screenshot of your program and post your bucket list to Twitter by clicking the icon below.

The days are long but the years are short; from the whole Codédex team, we hope you accomplish all of your wildest dreams!
